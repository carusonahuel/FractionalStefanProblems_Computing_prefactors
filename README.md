# FractionalStefanProblems_Computing_prefactors
This code computes the prefactors of the free boundary in one-dimensional, one-phase Time/Space Fractional Stefan Problems.

The file StefanProb_Space_or_Time_FracDeriv.m can compute the prefactor of the free boundary for both the Time Fractiona Stefan Problem and Space Fractional Stefan Problem. This code allows for a fixed fraction order between 0 and 1 to compute the corresponding prefactor for several Stefan's constants towards 0.
